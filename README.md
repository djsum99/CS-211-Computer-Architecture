# CS-211-Computer-Architecture

These are some of the projects that I did while taking Computer Architecture (CS 211) at Rutgers. All of these projects were done in C.

1. PA1
    - first
        - Uses insertion sort to sort numbers in a txt file in the following way: even numbers in ascending order followed by odd numbers in descending order
    - second
        - Manipulates a sorted linked list by inserting or deleting numbers from a txt file one at a time, and then prints number of nodes followed by all the unique values in the linked list
    - third
        - Uses the numbers in a txt file to create a hash table, and prints the number of collisions when inserting the numbers and the number of successful searches for a certain number
    - fourth
        - Multiplies two matrices located in a txt file together and prints the product
    - fifth
        - Prints all of the vowels in a string
    - sixth
        - Creates a binary search tree using numbers from a txt file, then prints the inorder traversal of the tree
